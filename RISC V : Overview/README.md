## Introduction
This project focuses on the implementation and verification of the RISC-V RV32I Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). It is structured into three primary tasks:

1. **C-Language Code to Assembly Conversion:** Writing a C program and converting it to assembly language using RISC-V tools.
2. **Understanding RISC-V Instructions and Formats:** Studying the different types of RISC-V instructions and their respective formats.
3. **Implementation of RISC-V RV32I ISA & Verification:** Implementing the RV32I ISA using Verilog and verifying it with GTKWave.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: C-Language Code to Assembly Conversion
In this task, we write a simple C program, compile it, and then use RISC-V tools to convert the compiled code into assembly language. This step helps in understanding how high-level code is translated into machine-level instructions.

### Task 2: RISC-V Instructions and Formats
This task involves studying the RISC-V instruction formats. RISC-V instructions are categorized into several types, each with a unique format. Understanding these formats is crucial for both writing and decoding RISC-V assembly language programs.

### Task 3: Implementation of RISC-V RV32I ISA & Verification
In the final task, we implement the RV32I ISA using Verilog. This includes creating a functional model of the RV32I processor and then verifying its correctness using simulation tools like GTKWave.

## Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding and working with the RISC-V architecture, from high-level programming to low-level hardware implementation.
